### Overview  

This is an experiment of sweet potato detection using a Keras implemented SSD model architecture introduced by Wei Liu et al. in the paper [SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325)

The main code can be viewed from [SSD7_sweetpotato_20220826.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/aipal-nchu/sweet_potato_detection/blob/master/SSD7_sweetpotato_20220826.ipynb)
